# flappy-bird-type-game

A flappy bird type game created with html, css. A web game application where as the user, the player has to avoid getting hit by obstacles meeting their way.
The keys are used to move the bird in the direction you want it to be.

# Lessons learned

My first game type application where I had to learn how to implement classes to hold the player information/details, functions designed to implement scores, what happens when new obstacles happen and etc. 

# Potential future features

Prob have drawn images as obstacles to be more creative and to feel like its my own. 

# Deployment
